acedgfb cdfbe gcdfa fbcad dab cefabd cdfgeb eafb cagedb ab | cdfeb fcadb cdfeb cdbaf

acedgfb [abcdefg] 	- 8
ab 		[ab]		- 1
dab 	[abd]		- 7
eafb 	[abef]		- 4

count digits missing one of the '1' segments (a or b)
	- digit '2' is the only one missing one of them:

gcdfa   [acdfg]		- 2

diff 1 and 7 to get A:
(A = d)

that means we solved for C
(C = b)

that also means we solved for B
(B = a)

3 is only one segment away from 2

fbcad 	[abcdf]		- 3

we know the difference in 2 is segment E
E = g

5 is only one segment away from 3

cdfbe 	[bcdef]	 	- 5

we know the difference in 5 is segment F
F = e

we can then solve for 0

cagedb 	[abcdeg]	- 0

then we know segment D
D = c

The missing segment is f

now we know the rest
